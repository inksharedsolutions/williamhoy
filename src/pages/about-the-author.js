                                I, William D. Hoy was born in San Diego, California and raised in Chula Vista a

                                I made my entry into the movie business as an actor while living
                                in San Francisco, appearing in some famous movies such as, In pursuit 
                                of Happiness; Money Ball; Milk; Four Christmases; and some not so famous 
                                ones such as; Mail Order Bride; Her Best Move; Ellen Bond Secret Agent;
                                Subprime Children; Control Tower; Violent Jake; and a half a dozen non-fiction 
                                shorts with, The World Astonishing News a Duo-Communications Production.
